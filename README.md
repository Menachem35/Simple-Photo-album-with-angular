# Simple-Photo-album-with-angular
Simple photo album with Angular and RESTful API

A simple web application to display photo album. 
Home page presents list of photo albums (title, ownerâ€™s name, and number of photos). Clicking on an album shows list of photos with thumbnails

For this example, I usued data which come from the JSONPlaceholder fake API (http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

Feel free to use my code.
